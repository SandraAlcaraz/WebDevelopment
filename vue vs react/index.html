  <tr>
    <td>Performance</td>
    <td>A component’s dependencies are automatically tracked during its render, so the system knows precisely which components actually need to re-render when state changes.</td> 
    <td>A component’s state changes, it triggers the re-render of the entire component sub-tree, starting at that component as root.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Templating vs JSX</td>
    <td> A template is just additional syntax on top of plain HTML and thus has very low learning cost for those who are already familiar with HTML.</td> 
    <td> JSX, is a React extension that allows us to write JavaScript that looks like HTML.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CSS</td>
    <td>many of the popular CSS-in-JS libraries support Vue </td> 
    <td>The default method of styling in React is through less familiar style tags in single-file components</td>
  </tr>
	  <tr>
    <td>Ecosystem
</td>
    <td>Vue leaves less up to the community, instead keeping important libraries in sync</td> 
    <td>Is much larger than Vue’s, but it can also make it overwhelming for newcomers.</td>
